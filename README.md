# Comp305 Final Project - beatiful-zeros

## How to run the code ##

    The program consists of a two files: Operations.java and Test.java. To run the code, please run compile and link the files together.

## Deliverables
    Baseline Algorithm further enhancements and Proof of Correctness can be found in ALGORITHM.md
    Test Cases and corresponding runtimes can be found in TESTING.md
