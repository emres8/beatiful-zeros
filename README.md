# beatiful-zeros


Amir loves binary strings, and whenever he gets bored, he makes a new challenge about binary strings to entertain himself. However, recently, he has devised a problem that really irritates him since he could not find a solution.
The game starts with n string of ones, and Amirâ€™s goal is to turn all the ones to zeros. There are some rules that govern the game which are as follow:
1. You are allowed to change a bit in the sequence, however, all the bits with the most k distance would be toggled. For example, if k=2, then if you change a specific bit in the sequence the next two adjacent bits are also toggled.
2. The cost of changing the value of i-th bit is equal to ci

## Comp305 Final Project

* 12 May 
* 17 May  
  * Discussed Greedy Approach & Proof of Correctness of the suggested algorithm
  * Work-load is distributed among group members
* 2 June 
  * Started to prepare presentation
  * Revision on the code
* 3 June 
  * Presentation, repository finalized
